# • Process
- Preparation: Develop an incident response plan, train teams, deploy monitoring tools, and establish policies to ensure readiness.
- Detection: Monitor systems for abnormal activity, analyze alerts, and identify potential incidents promptly.
- Analysis: Confirm the incident, determine its type and scope, and assess its potential impact through forensic investigation.
- Containment: Implement short- and long-term measures to limit the spread of the incident and prevent further damage.
- Eradication: Remove all traces of the threat(e.g., malware, vulnerablities) from affected systems and ensure they are secure.
- Recovery: Restore affected systems, monitor for recurring issues, and gradually return operations to normal while ensuring security.
- Lessons learned: Review the incident, identify improvements, and update the incident response plan to enhance future responses.
# • Training
# • Testing
- Tabletop exercise: A type of simulated scenario-based exercise used to test and evaluate an organization's incident response, disaster recovery, or busniess continuity plans in a controlled environment. These exercises are typically conducted in a meeting room or virtual setting, with key personnel discussing how they would respond to a simulated crisis.
- Simulation: Controlled exercise that replicates real-world scenarios to practice respones and improve preparedness. In cybersecurity, simulations mimic incidents like cyberattacks to help teams assess and refine their response plans without actual risks.
# • Root cause analysis
# • Threat hunting
# • Digital forensics
- Legal hold: A process that an organization follows to preserve all relevant information and evidence when it anticipates that litigation, an investigation, or regulatory action may occur. The goal of a legal hold is to prevent the destruction, alteration, or deletion of information that could be crucial for the case.
- Chain of custody: The process of documenting the movement and handling of evidence, ensuring its integrity from the moment it is collected until it is presented in court or used in an investigation. Is it critical in legal, forensic, and regulatory contexts to ensure that evidence has not been tampered with, altered, or contaminated.
- Acquisition: In the context of digital forensics and incident response, refers to the process of collecting data or evidence from a system or device in a manner that preserves its integrity and ensures it remains admissible for analysis or legal proceedings.
- Reporting: In the context of incident response, digital foresics, or cybersecurity refers to the process of documenting and communicating the findings, actions, and outcomes related to a security incident, investigation, or forensic analysis.
- Preservation: In the context of digital forensics and incident response refers to the process of maintaining the integrity of potential evidence, ensuring that it remains unchanged, uncorrupted, and accessible for analysis, legal proceedings, or regulatory compliance.
