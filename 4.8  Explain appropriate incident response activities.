• Process
- Preparation: Develop an incident response plan, train teams, deploy monitoring tools, and establish policies to ensure readiness.
- Detection: Monitor systems for abnormal activity, analyze alerts, and identify potential incidents promptly.
- Analysis: Confirm the incident, determine its type and scope, and assess its potential impact through forensic investigation.
- Containment: Implement short- and long-term measures to limit the spread of the incident and prevent further damage.
- Eradication: Remove all traces of the threat(e.g., malware, vulnerablities) from affected systems and ensure they are secure.
- Recovery: Restore affected systems, monitor for recurring issues, and gradually return operations to normal while ensuring security.
- Lessons learned: Review the incident, identify improvements, and update the incident response plan to enhance future responses.
